Contributing
===============================

Nowaday, it has never been easier to contribute on a project. Indeed, the
contribution can be made mainly in two ways:

1. Make any modification, in sending a pull request.
2. Report an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Prisma/prisma-app/issues)
if you find bugs, have suggestions or any other problems.

Feel free to contact <a href="mailto:frederik.vincx@gmail.com">frederik.vincx@gmail.com</a> to
ask your questions and/or to discuss contributions.
